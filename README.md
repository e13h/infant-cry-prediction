# infant-cry-prediction
Predict why your baby is crying with a neural network.

## Use the Pretrained Model (or train your own!)

To run the code, open one of the corresponding notebooks and click the "Open in Colab" button at the top. The following links redirect to corresponding Jupyter Notebooks in the repository.

* [Predict why a baby is crying](./predict.ipynb) (using a single recording and the pretrained model)
* [Evaluate a trained model](./evaluate_checkpoint.ipynb)
* [Train a new model](./train.ipynb)

## Local Installation
To build the code on a local machine, create a conda environment to install all necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
